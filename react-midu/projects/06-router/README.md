# React Router

This project is a basic implementation of a router for React applications, designed to meet the needs of both Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Multiple Page Applications (MPAs). The main goal is to provide smooth navigation between different views of the application while maintaining user experience.

## Features

- **MPAs and SPAs:** This router can be used to create both single-page and multiple-page applications.
- **Back Button Navigation:** Allows navigation between pages using the browser's back button.
- **Link Component:** Provides a Link component for declarative navigation.
- **Router Component:** Offers a Router component to facilitate route declaration.
- **Default Route (404):** Supports defining a default route to handle requests for non-existent routes.
- **Routes with Parameters:** Allows the definition of routes with dynamic parameters to handle different use cases.
- **Lazy Loading:** Implements lazy loading of routes to improve performance.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** Offers support for internationalizing routes, allowing adaptation to different languages.
- **Testing:** Includes tests to ensure the router functions correctly.
- **NPM Publishing:** Includes instructions on how to log in to NPM and publish the package for use by other developers.
